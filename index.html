        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Take on the role of a new high school student who interacts with a cast
            of characters, including classmates and teachers. What happens to your
            character after high school is up to you: Every choice impacts the future!

	<h2>FAQ</h2>

    <p class="question">
        How can a teacher incorporate this into a lesson on STEM?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        Our team developed a workshop format that will be published soon.
        The activity has three parts. First, we ask the students to talk
        about STEM, including what it is and what it means.
        Then, we have them play the game in small groups.
        Finally, we have the groups discuss how and why they made their
        decisions while playing the game.
        If there is time, we add a fourth component: we ask the students
        to imagine the cast of the game and then write new stories
        that would fit into the game's format.
    </p>

	<p class="question">
	  How can I put my own stories into the game?
	</p>
	<p class="answer">
	  Our game is open source! You can download
	  <a href="https://github.com/stem-career-paths/game">the
	  complete source code to the game from GitHub</a>. Adding new
	  stories requires a little bit of programming knowledge, but
	  you can get started by looking at the files in
	  the <code>stories/starting_stories</code> folder.  If you
	  simply copy one of those and tweak it, you should see the
	  story show up in your local game.  Because our game
	  is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free
	  software</a>, you can make any changes you want and release
	  your own version, as long as your own version remains
	  free. See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the
	  license</a> for complete legal details.
